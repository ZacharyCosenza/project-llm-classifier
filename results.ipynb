    "For this run I trained a small NN head on top of a distilBERT LLM with hidden size 768, layers 6, heads 12. The model is very simple: text is tokenized using distilbert-base-uncased with max length 512, passed to LLM where I take the last layer output (size 768) for A and B, concatenate them, then pass them into the head. This produces logits which are classified A/B/Tie. For batch size 32, 3 epochs with AdamW and lr of 1e-5 resulted in accuracy no better than chance (~33%)."
